CROSS JOIN >>>> A cross join in SQL is a type of join that produces the Cartesian product of two tables. This means that every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.

-----------SQL Practice -----------

show tables

select * from persons

>>> Insert Data Only in Specified Columns

INSERT INTO Persons(P_Id, LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME) VALUES (5, 'Tjessem', 'Jakob')

select * from persons

>>> Update Statement

UPDATE Persons
SET Address='Nissestien 67', City='Sandnes'
WHERE LAST_NAME='Tjessem' AND FIRST_NAME='Jakob'

select * from persons

>> SQL UPDATE Warning ---> Be careful when updating records. If we had omitted the WHERE clause in the example above, like this:

UPDATE Persons
SET Address='Nissestien 67', City='Sandnes'

select * from persons

>>> The DELETE Statement

drop table persons

show tables

create table Persons (P_id int, Last_name varchar(10), First_Name varchar (10), Address string, City String) 

select * from persons

insert into Persons (P_id, Last_name, First_Name , Address, City) VALUES (1, 'Hansen', 'Ola', 'Timoteivn 10', 'Sandnes'), (2, 'Svendson', 'Tove', 'Borgvn 23', 'Sandnes' ), (3, 'Pettersen', 'Kari', 'Storgt 20', 'Stavanger')

select * from persons

INSERT INTO Persons VALUES (4,'Nilsen', 'Johan', 'Bakken 2', 'Stavanger')

select * from persons
INSERT INTO Persons(P_Id, Last_Name, First_Name) VALUES (5, 'Tjessem', 'Jakob')

UPDATE Persons
SET Address='Nissestien 67', City='Sandnes'
WHERE Last_Name='Tjessem' AND First_Name='Jakob'

select * from persons

DELETE FROM Persons
WHERE Last_Name='Tjessem' AND First_Name='Jakob'

select * from persons

>>> Delete All Rows
Syntax > DELETE FROM table_name
or
DELETE * FROM table_name

>>>> The TOP Clause
The TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

SELECT *
FROM Persons
LIMIT 5

>>> SQL TOP Example
Now we want to select only the two first records in the table above.

SELECT TOP 2 * FROM Persons

>>> SQL TOP PERCENT Example

SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT *FROM Persons >> Error - From

>>> SQL Wildcards
SQL wildcards can be used when searching for data in a database.
âž¢ SQL wildcards can substitute for one or more characters when searching for data in a database.

>>>Using the % Wildcard

Select * from PERSONS

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE Lower (City) LIKE 'sa%'

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE lower (City) LIKE '%nes%'

>>> Using the _ Wildcard

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '_la'

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE LAST_NAME LIKE 'S_end_on'

>>> Using the [charlist] Wildcard

SELECT * FROM Persons

SELECT * FROM Persons                        >>ERROR
WHERE LAST_NAME LIKE '[BSP]%'            

> last name that do not start from b,s,p

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE LAST_NAME LIKE '[!bsp]%'                    >>Error

>>>  The LIKE Operator

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE City LIKE 'S%'

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE City LIKE '%s'

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE City LIKE '%tav%'

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE City NOT LIKE '%tav%'

>>>IN OPERATOR

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE LAST_NAME IN ('Hansen','Pettersen')

>>>>The BETWEEN Operator

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE LAST_NAME
BETWEEN 'Hansen' AND 'Pettersen'

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE LAST_NAME
NOT BETWEEN 'Hansen' AND 'Pettersen'

>>> SQL Alias

SQL Alias Syntax for Tables:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
AS alias_name

>>>>>> SQL JOIN

SQL joins are used to query data from two or more tables, based on a relationship between certain
columns in these tables.
The JOIN keyword is used in an SQL statement to query data from two or more tables, based on a
relationship between certain columns in these tables.

Select * from persons

create table Orders (O_Id int, OrderNo int, P_Id int)

insert into Orders (O_Id , OrderNo , P_Id ) values (1,77895,3), (2, 44678,3), (3, 22456, 1), (4, 24562,1), (5, 34764, 15)

Select * from ORDERS

SELECT Persons.Last_Name, Persons.FIRST_NAME, Orders.OrderNo
FROM Persons INNER JOIN Orders ON Persons.P_Id=Orders.P_Id
ORDER BY Persons.LAST_NAME

SELECT Persons.Last_Name, Persons.FIRST_NAME, Orders.OrderNo
FROM Persons LEFT JOIN Orders ON Persons.P_Id=Orders.P_Id
ORDER BY Persons.LAST_NAME

SELECT Persons.Last_Name, Persons.FIRST_NAME, Orders.OrderNo
FROM Persons RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Persons.P_Id=Orders.P_Id
ORDER BY Persons.LAST_NAME

SELECT Persons.Last_Name, Persons.FIRST_NAME, Orders.OrderNo
FROM Persons FULL JOIN Orders ON Persons.P_Id=Orders.P_Id
ORDER BY Persons.LAST_NAME
