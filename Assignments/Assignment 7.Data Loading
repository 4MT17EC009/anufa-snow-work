>> Create a Database First
create database OUR_FIRST_DB;

>> Create a Table
CREATE TABLE OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.LOAN_PAYMENT (
  Loan_ID STRING,
  loan_status STRING,
  Principal STRING,
  terms STRING,
  effective_date STRING,
  due_date STRING,
  paid_off_time STRING,
  past_due_days STRING,
  age STRING,
  education STRING,
  Gender STRING);

Once Database is created we need to load the data from Amazon S3 Bucket to Snowflake

Use database OUR_FIRST_DB;

SELECT * FROM LOAN_PAYMENT;

//Loading the data from S3 bucket

COPY INTO LOAN_PAYMENT
    FROM s3://bucketsnowflakes3/Loan_payments_data.csv
    file_format = (type = csv 
                   field_delimiter = ',' 
                   skip_header=1);

//Validate
SELECT * FROM LOAN_PAYMENT;

>>Lets delete everything from loan_payment table and let us load it externally after downloading the validation
>> If we have data in our local system Steps to load the file
- Go to your Database
- Go to your Table select Table, browse and ADD File

Delete from loan_payment

Select * From loan_payment

>> Applying Transformation on Age if he is minor or major
select 
  LOAN_ID
,LOAN_STATUS
,PRINCIPAL
,TERMS
,EFFECTIVE_DATE
,DUE_DATE
,PAID_OFF_TIME
,PAST_DUE_DAYS
,EDUCATION
,GENDER
,AGE
,case when age > 21 then 'Major' else 'Minor' end  as "Status"
from LOAN_PAYMENT  order by age asc 


--- ETL ---
To tansform we need to keep files in some loaction called STAGE (Storage Location)
After Extracting we need to takje into stages and perform transformation and then use copy Command to send to Snowflake

>> Create a Stage
create or replace stage OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ext_loan_stage 
    url= 's3://bucketsnowflakes3/Loan_payments_data.csv'

Lets identify if file is in the stage

list @OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ext_loan_stage ;

CREATE TABLE OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.LOAN_PAYMENT_V1 (
  Loan_ID STRING,
  loan_status STRING,
  Principal STRING,
  terms STRING,
  effective_date STRING,
  due_date STRING,
  paid_off_time STRING,
  past_due_days STRING,
  age STRING,
  education STRING,
  Gender STRING);

select * from LOAN_PAYMENT_V1;

COPY INTO LOAN_PAYMENT_V1
    FROM @OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ext_loan_stage
    file_format = (type = csv 
                   field_delimiter = ',' 
                   skip_header=1);

--- Performing ETL ---
extracting and creating stage is done
>> Lets not consider all columns, we need 3 columns

CREATE TABLE OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.LOAN_PAYMENT_V2 (
  Loan_ID STRING,
  loan_status STRING,
  age int);

select * from loan_payment_v2 ;

COPY INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.LOAN_PAYMENT_V2 (Loan_ID,loan_status,age)
    FROM (select 
            s.$1,
            s.$2,
            s.$9
           -- case when s.$9 > 21 then 'Major' else 'Minor' end  as "Status"
          from @OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ext_loan_stage s)
    file_format= (type = csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1) ;

//Validate
select * from loan_payment_v2 ;

CREATE or replace TABLE OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.LOAN_PAYMENT_V3 (
  Loan_ID STRING,
  loan_status STRING,
  age int,
  eligible string);

select * from LOAN_PAYMENT_V3;

COPY INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.LOAN_PAYMENT_V3 (Loan_ID,loan_status,age,eligible)
    FROM (select 
            s.$1,
            s.$2,
            s.$9,
            case when s.$9 > 25 then 'Major' else 'Minor' end  as "eligible"
          from @OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ext_loan_stage s)
    file_format= (type = csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1) ;

// validate
select * from LOAN_PAYMENT_V3;
