>> GIT and GITHUB
Git and GitHub are often used together, but they serve different purposes. Here's a breakdown of each:

--- GIT --
>> VERSION CONTROL TOOL - Software 
We are preparing SQL and keeping into local system, we need to place it at repositories. 
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes to source code over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
Version Control: Keeps a history of changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.

--- GIT HUB ---
>> Code Repository
>> One of the cloud based platform where we can store all programs, and if access is public anyone can see all the codes and scripts
Ex - If a person A has joined a new organisation and in a week has completed 90% of task, rest of the work to be assigned to Person B or C, if all the work is in local system, it becomes difficult so, GITHUB
-- If so much of work in on local machine, system might crash and you may loose data so on daily basis pushing of data into github is imp
